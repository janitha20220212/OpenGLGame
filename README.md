OpenGL Game Project
This repository documents my journey learning OpenGL through a project.

Credits go to TheCherno for creating an amazing tutorial series on OpenGL.

Day One

Progress:
Setup Visual Studio on my PC.
Downloaded the GLFW OpenGL Library.
Configured GLFW in a Visual Studio project.

Linked necessary folders and files:
Added the path of the Source folder and the lib32 2022 folder to the Properties.
Linked the Source folder to the include directories.
Linked the lib folder to the additional directories under Linker.
Added the following file names to the input section: glfw3.lib, opengl32.lib, User32.lib, Gdi32.lib, Shell32.lib.
Learned how to resolve errors if any of the above libraries were not linked properly.
Drew a triangle on a black screen.

Challenges Faced:
Understanding Visual Studio project configurations.
Resolving linker errors.
